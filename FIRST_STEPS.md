```

### Step 2: Create Your First API Integration
Create file: `backend/api-gateway/src/services/yourApiService.ts`
```typescript
export class YourApiService {
  async getLiveCalls() {
    // This is where you'll connect to your API
    const response = await fetch(process.env.YOUR_API_URL + '/live-calls', {
      headers: {
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${process.env.YOUR_API_KEY}`
      }
    });
    return response.json();
